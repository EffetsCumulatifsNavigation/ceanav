## Cumulative valued components {#cvcumresult}

> The method used to obtain the following results is presented in section \@ref(cvcummethod) of the report.

The assessment of cumulative valued components shows that the entire study area is covered by at least one valued component (Figures \@ref(fig:cvCum) and \@ref(fig:cvCumNorm)). Coastal environments, however, are generally covered by a greater number of valued components. This is primarily influenced by the bank integrity and habitat valued components, which are predominantly described as coastal, and by a significant number of areas of interest in coastal environments (Figure \@ref(fig:cvPanel)). The entire fluvial coastal environment is characterized by several valued components, but the Lake St. Pierre region, including both upstream and downstream areas, appears to be particularly important (Figures \@ref(fig:cvCum) and \@ref(fig:cvCumNorm)). On closer examination, this region is characterized by a significant diversity of habitats and areas of interest, and has several categories of erosion-sensitive banks (Figure \@ref(fig:cvPanel)).

In general, the fluvial sector is characterized by more valued components than the marine sector. The area of the marine sector presenting with the greatest number of valued components is the mouth of the Saguenay River, which essentially covers the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park (Figures \@ref(fig:cvCum) and \@ref(fig:cvCumNorm)). This observation is based on the important diversity of marine mammals that frequent this region and on a large number of areas of interest (Figure \@ref(fig:cvPanel)). It is also important to remember that the characterization of the bank integrity valued component was limited to the fluvial sector only.
