# Assessment results {#resultats}

The following sections present the main results of the cumulative effects assessment. We begin by presenting and discussing results from the partial models, *i.e.* [cumulative stressors](#strcummethod), [cumulative valued components](#cvcummethod), and [cumulative exposure](#cumexpmethod); these results provide a starting point for interpreting the cumulative effects assessment results by exploring smaller portions of the full assessment. We then present the results of the full cumulative effects assessment based on the assessment [general model](#ceamethod).
