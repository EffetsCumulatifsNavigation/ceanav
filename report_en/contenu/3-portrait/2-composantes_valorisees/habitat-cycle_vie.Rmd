Spawning sites are environments critical to the maintenance of fish populations; indeed, disturbances to these sites, or to species behaviour during the spawning period, can have major impacts on fish population dynamics. Similarly, feeding and protection sites for early life stages of fish (*e.g.* larvae, fry, juveniles) are much more susceptible to disturbances to their habitat. These sites, called nursery areas, are thus critical to fish survival. This means that the protection of spawning and nursery sites is of major importance since they constitute a bottleneck for fish population dynamics.

The data used to characterize spawning and nursery areas come from an *in situ* observation data integration exercise covering the period from 1974 to 2019 [@mffp2020; Table \@ref(tab:frayerealevinage)]. The identified spawning and nursery sites aggregate data for 71 and 49 fish species, respectively, and cover an area of approximately 275 and 230 $km^2$ within the study area. The data aggregate confirmed or potential spawning and nursery sites where habitats were deemed suitable for fish spawning or rearing. Therefore, it is likely that these data are partial and should not be considered an exhaustive description of spawning and nursery sites in the study area. The data are composed of points and polygons. We added a 100 $m$ buffer zone around the points, and then incorporated the presence of spawning sites within our 1 $km^2$ study grid.

It should be noted that the data used covers only the fluvial portion of the study area; additional data should be added to properly characterize the entire study area.

The data used to characterize sites of importance to birds came from two separate sources that were inserted into the study grid on a presence-absence basis. The first database, which describes the location of bird colonies, is called the [Computerized Database of Quebec Seabirds](https://ogsl.ca/en/biodiversity-birds-eccc-biomq-about/) [CDQS; @rail2002; @eccc2021]. This database was compiled and is updated by the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) for the Quebec region. The CDQS contains information on the location of seabird colonies and their nesting sites for the following families: Gaviidae (*i.e.* loons), Hydrobatidae (*i.e.* petrels), Sulidae (*i.e.* gannets/boobies), Phalacrocoracidae (*i.e.* cormorants), Laridae (*i.e.* seagulls, gulls, terns), Alcidae (*i.e.* guillemots, penguins, puffins), and the common eider (*i.e.* Anatidae). For our analysis, we considered only the location of the various colonies available through the CDQS without considering individual species in order to identify the locations that are home to seabird colonies. We also used data from the year 2000 onward only. Our study area included `r meta$dataDescription$BIOMQ$Nombre` sites with a total area of `r meta$dataDescription$BIOMQ$Superficie` $km^2$.

The second database identified Important Bird Areas [IBAs; @oiseauxcanada2015; @etudesoiseauxcanada2015]. IBAs are identified based on information on threatened bird species, sites with significant bird populations, or range-restricted species. Internationally accepted assessment [criteria](https://www.ibacanada.org/documents/current_Canadian_IBA_Criteria.pdf) are used to identify IBAs. Our study area covers `r meta$dataDescription$ZICO$Nombre` IBA sites with a total area of `r meta$dataDescription$ZICO$Superficie` $km^2$.

It is important to note that these sites are land environments, meaning that they do not properly capture aquatic and marine use environments associated with these sites of importance. Extrapolation of a marine use area based on variables such as the species range and number of individuals would enable us to address this gap [*e.g.* @lieske2020]. However, it was not possible to conduct this type of analysis as part of this pilot project.
