#### Areas of interest to First Nations {#pnportrait}

In this pilot project, particular importance was assigned to areas of interest to First Nations. Marine activities may affect the conditions that underlie the exercise of First Nations’ Indigenous rights, especially in terms of access to resources and the land. A collaborative process was therefore initiated with Indigenous nations who conduct activities in the study area now or have done in the past. The following participating Indigenous Nations provided data

- Huron-Wendat Nation
- Innu Nation of Essipit
- Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke
- Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation
- W8banaki Nation

An information sharing protocol was developed in cooperation with the participating First Nations. This protocol provides a framework for data use that supports First Nations OCAP principles in research: PCAP$^{MD}$ (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession). Applying these principles serves to protect First Nations’ information and knowledge assets. These principles state that a community, a nation, or a group owns information collectively. These principles apply to all types and fields of research conducted on First Nations lands and/or that concern First Nations.

One-on-one meetings were held with representatives of participating First Nations to present the project and discuss the needs for information in order to incorporate the areas of interest into the cumulative effects assessment. The participating First Nations subsequently proceeded to gather cartographic and non-cartographic information representing their respective Nations’ areas of interest. Our research team therefore did not collect any data; this work was carried out by the participating First Nations, who subsequently sent us data designating areas of interest to be considered in the cumulative effects assessment of marine activities.

An open access cartographic atlas developed by the Mi’kmaq and Maliseet Aboriginal Fisheries Management Association [MMAFMA; @arsenault2017] also provided land use data for the Gespeg Mi’kmaq, Gesgapegiag Mi’kmaq and Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nations.

The areas of interest are generally identified through exercises to integrate knowledge from other studies conducted with First Nations members. The areas of interest identified by the participating First Nations can be broadly classified into 9 main categories:

- Ritual or social activities
- Hunting
- Culture and heritage
- Land use
- Commercial fishing
- Traditional fishing
- Harvesting of vegetation
- Archeological sites
- Tourism

The areas of interest identified by the Nations have been kept separate rather than integrated into a single layer by broad area of interest category, despite Nations identifying similar categories. For example, although most Nations identified areas of interest for hunting, the areas identified by individual First Nations remained separate for the cumulative effects assessment. This approach is intended to respect the independence of each Nation and to assign greater importance to an environment if it is identified by more than one Nation. This is the case of Lake St. Pierre, among other areas, which is identified as an area of interest by more than one participating Nation.

Each Nation organized and categorized its own areas of interest; these categories have been kept as reported despite similarities between the categories having been identified among the participating First Nations. There has been no attempt to harmonize categories among the First Nations. This choice was made in order to avoid distorting the information transmitted by the Nations. In addition, since the areas identified by the various Nations remain separate for the assessment, harmonizing the categories of areas of interest would not have affected the assessment. We thus decided to keep the wording used in the data transmitted.

There are a few points that must be kept in mind regarding areas of interest to First Nations. First, the information reported cannot be considered an exhaustive description of the areas of interest for all members of Indigenous Nations; the consultation process with the members of each Nation from which the information was derived was limited, and the information was integrated only in the context of the project assessing the cumulative effects of marine activities. The areas of interest identified come from other studies whose data were integrated to meet the objectives of this study. In addition, not all First Nations with an area of interest in the study area were able to be involved in the project. For example, despite the areas of interest for the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation being included, a collaborative process similar to that carried out with the other Nations could not be established; the socio-cultural data of the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation could therefore not be included in our assessment. The characterization of the areas of interest cannot be deemed exhaustive for all the First Nations in the region being studied.

Second, the First Nations’ connection to place goes beyond a strictly utilitarian and functional perspective; this perspective is difficult to capture through a mapping of areas of interest, which has the effect of objectifying them. This means it is important to consider that the areas of interest identified are part of a broader cultural and ecological context as opposed to a mere geographical location. 

Third, the concept of First Nations land use goes beyond mere use. Indeed, Indigenous customary activities are aboriginal rights protected by section 35(1) of the Canadian Constitution. The Constitution Act, 1982 affirms the existing aboriginal and treaty rights. However, most of these rights remain undefined and the Royal Proclamation of 1763 states that Aboriginal peoples continue to hold any lands they have not ceded or sold. It is therefore important to distinguish these food, ritual and social activities, which are protected by the Constitution and are linked to the Nation’s subsistence, from non-native fishing, hunting and trapping which are for sport and leisure.

Fourth, the spatio-temporal boundaries of the present study were raised as an important limitation in an Indigenous context since the study does not appropriately capture the evolving nature of their land occupation and use. The description of the areas of interest presented should not be interpreted as representative of the past or as a guarantee of the future. 

Lastly, the First Nations’ participation in this study is without prejudice to the exercise of their legal rights in their respective traditional territories to which their stewardship rights and responsibilities apply and which are based on the application of a broader ecosystemic approach. This means that the identified areas of interest must be interpreted in the broader context of these rights and responsibilities.

The following sections briefly describe the data shared by the participating First Nations and the data accessible through open platforms.

The Mi’kmaq and Maliseet Aboriginal Fisheries Management Association (MMAFMA) has developed a cartographic atlas describing various sites and uses related to commercial and traditional fishing that are of importance to the Gesgapegiag, Gespeg and Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nations [@arsenault2017]. The Atlas describes commercial fishing targeting nine different species: whelk (*Buccinum* sp.), sea cucumber (*Holothuria* sp.), rock crab (*Cancer irroratus*), snow crab (*Chionoecetes opilio*), northern shrimp (*Pandalus* sp.), Atlantic halibut (*Hippoglossus hippoglossus*), Greenland halibut (*Reinhardtius hippoglossoides*), lobster (*Homarus americanus*), and sea urchin (*Strongylocentrotus* sp.) in the St. Lawrence Estuary [@arsenault2017; @racine2017]. Since most of these fisheries are conducted by the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation, these data are used to describe that Nation’s commercial fisheries (see section \@ref(pnwwportrait)). Since the Gespeg Mi’kmaq Nation also has a commercial northern shrimp fishery in the St. Lawrence Estuary, we selected this fishery from the Atlas data.

The Atlas also identifies the Rimouski, Métis and Matane rivers as sites of importance to Atlantic salmon fishing [*Salmo salar*; @arsenault2017]. We added a 3 $km$ buffer zone at the mouth of these three rivers to capture their presence as an area of interest for the assessment.

The data transmitted by the Innu Nation of Essipit are an integration of data from various sources [@bouchard2021]:

- Inventory of archeological sites in Quebec.
- Innu-Aitun follow-up, 2004 to 2018, Essipit.
- History of the commercial (snow crab, sea urchin) and food (Atlantic halibut) fisheries, 1996 to 2020, Essipit.
- Atlas of coastal and marine uses of the St. Lawrence by the Innu of the North Shore, Agence Mamu Innu Kaikusseht, 2019.
- Collection of data on the harvesting of migratory birds in seven Innu communities of the North Shore, Agence Mamu Innu Kaihusseht, 2014

The result of the integration of these data provides the location of areas of interest located in the St. Lawrence Estuary and the Saguenay River. These areas are divided into seven categories: 

- Migratory bird hunting
- Seal hunting
- Commercial fishing
- Traditional fishing
- Tourist activities
- Access to the water
- Culture and heritage

These categories of area of interest are used in the marine activities cumulative effects assessment in the study area. It is important to note that the original data used cover a wider area than the study area of this assessment, but were intersected and limited to our study area.

```

<br/>

The data transmitted by the Huron-Wendat Nation provide the location of areas of interest mainly in the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence and the estuary, and to a lesser extent in the St. Lawrence estuary [@nhw2021]. The areas are composed of nine themes divided into three unique categories: 

- Contemporary sites 
  - Ritual or social activities
  - Hunting
  - Fishing
  - Harvesting of vegetation
  - Land use
- Ecological sites
  - Species at risk
- Heritage sites 
  - Archeology
  - History 
  - Toponymy

The land use category groups together various types of areas of interest for the Huron-Wendat Nation. A general formula for designating these areas has been kept due to the sensitivity of the data included. The themes were considered as unique categories of valued components for the cumulative effects assessment. It is important to note that the original data used cover a wider area than the study area of this assessment, but were intersected and limited to our study area.

<br/>

The data transmitted by the Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke provide the location of areas of interest in the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence River in the Montreal and Lake St. Pierre area [@mck2021]. The areas identified focus primarily on hunting, fishing and vegetation harvesting activities for a variety of important species, cultural sites, and the use of certain portions of the territory by the Nation. These areas can be divided into seven categories:

- Activities
  - Waterfowl hunting
  - Open water fishing
  - Shoreline fishing
  - Vegetation harvesting 
- Sites of importance 
  - Culture and heritage
- Land use 
  - Seigneurie du Sault-Saint-Louis
  - Shipping

The sites making up these eight categories were used for the cumulative effects assessment of marine activities. It is important to note that the original data used cover a wider area than the study area of this assessment, but were intersected and limited to our study area.

A clause accompanies the shared data, which we take the liberty of transcribing in its entirety in English: 

> The Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke (MCK) has gathered some information from community members concerning the value and use of the St. Lawrence River in the vicinity of Kahnawà:ke. These comments have been organized according to the valued components identified for the fluvial section of the river through the Cumulative Effects of Marine Shipping by the Transport Canada team in collaboration with project partners. Therefore, the information provided is based on a limited consultation of community members, with the intent of responding to the specific parameters of this Transport Canada study only and should not be interpreted as a comprehensive study of Mohawk traditional land use or rights throughout the study area. The information provided should also not be used to replace engagement, including the gathering of traditional land use information within the context of any other future study or project. In addition, our participation in this study is without prejudice to the exercise of our jurisdictional rights to our traditional territory to which our stewardship rights and responsibilities apply and that are based on the application of a broader ecosystem-based approach. Therefore, the identification of specific areas of concern or value, including the identification of specific fish species or archeological sites of interest is to be understood within the context of these broader rights and responsibilities.

Although data were provided by the Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke and incorporated into the cumulative effects assessment, it was requested that maps of identified sites not be presented. For more information, please contact the *Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke*. The original request to remove the figures is as follows:

> The Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke provided information concerning some known sites of interest related to the activities mentioned above. These data were incorporated into the cumulative effects assessment however it was requested that the delineation of these areas not be shown within this report. For further information on this data, please contact the Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke

As part of this pilot project, the Grand Council of the Waban-Aki Nation (Grand Conseil de la Nation Waban-Aki, GCNWA) integrated spatialized and non-spatialized information from semi-directed individual and small group land use interviews previously conducted with members of the Nation. These studies include a sample of 33 respondents from 74 interviews. The mapping is supported by qualitative information primarily from 1) two focus group workshops held in 2016, workshop interviews held between 2019 and 2020 with women from the Nation, and 3) impact assessment analyses of port expansion projects on the Nation’s ancestral rights. This integrative work has led to the production of a report outlining the known concerns of some Nation members about environmental pressures within their territory affecting the valued components covered by our marine activities cumulative effects assessment [@gcnwa2021]. 

The data provided by the GCNWA provide the location of areas of interest primarily in the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence River [@gcnwa2021]. The identified sites are divided into 13 distinct categories: 

- Contemporary land use and occupation 
  - Fishing (*e.g.* perch, walleye, sturgeon)
  - Migratory bird hunting (*e.g.* snow geese, Canada geese)
  - Game hunting (*e.g.* white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse)
  - Trapping of furbearing species (*e.g.* muskrat, snowshoe hare)
  - Harvesting and gathering of vegetation (*e.g.* cattail, fiddlehead)
  - Shipping 
  - Overnight site (*e.g.* camps)
  - Essential sites (*e.g.* baiting sites, calling sites)
  - Activity areas (*e.g.* hunting area, trapping area)
  - Problems related to the territory (*e.g.* site to which access has been lost)
- Heritage, cultural and archeological sites
  - Cultural sites (*e.g.* gathering site, sacred or ritual place)
  - Archeological sites
  - Sites with archeological potential

These categories of areas of interest are used in the marine activities cumulative effects assessment in the study area. It is important to note that the original data used cover a wider area than the study area of this assessment, but were intersected and limited to our study area.

We are using data provided to us by representatives of the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation to characterize sites of importance to the commercial lobster [*Homarus americanus*; @pnww2021] fishery. These data identify environments deemed important to fishing on the south shore of the St. Lawrence. These data were complemented with data from the MMAFMA (see section \@ref(aghammportrait)) on commercial fishing of whelk (*Buccinum* sp.), sea cucumber (*Holothuria* sp.), rock crab (*Cancer irroratus*), snow crab (*Chionoecetes opilio*), northern shrimp (*Pandalus* sp.), Atlantic halibut (*Hippoglossus hippoglossus*), Greenland halibut (*Reinhardtius hippoglossoides*), lobster (*Homarus americanus*), and sea urchin (*Strongylocentrotus* sp.) in the St. Lawrence Estuary [@arsenault2017; @racine2017]. 

Two areas of interest for beluga whale watching and harbour development are also considered areas of interest for the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation [@pnww2022]. It is important to note, however, that despite the inclusion of areas of interest to the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation, a collaborative process similar to that carried out with the other Nations could not be established. This means that the socio-cultural data of the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation could not be included in our assessment.
