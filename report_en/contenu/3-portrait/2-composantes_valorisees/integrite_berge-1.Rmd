The bank integrity valued component was characterized using geospatial data from a recent bank characterization exercise in the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence River by Patrick Lajeunesse’s team at Université Laval [@bernier2020; @bernier2021]. This characterization was conducted using a high-resolution mapping approach to spatially position, characterize and assess natural and artificial banks’ susceptibility to erosion; this was done using a combination of data from land surveys, remote sensing, and local community knowledge [@bernier2020; @bernier2021]. The geospatial data from this project provide a characterization of bank erosion susceptibility by classifying their state in a three-level erosion index [EI; Figure 2 in @bernier2021]:

- Active (EI = 2): Apparent erosion or vegetation cover < 25%
- Semi-vegetated (EI = 1): Apparent erosion or vegetation cover of 25 to 75%
- Stable or vegetated (EI = 0): No apparent signs of erosion, and vegetation cover > 75% or presence of a protective structure

For our study, we consider only those banks that have apparent signs of erosion, i.e., banks with an EI > 0. We also distinguish between natural and artificial banks; this distinction is made to separate the effects of shipping on natural banks, which have a higher ecological value than artificial banks. Combining the condition of the banks as described in @bernier2020 and @bernier2021 and the degraded state of the artificialities thus results in four categories of banks susceptible to the effects of erosion (Table \@ref(tab:bergeCat)).

<br/>

```{r bergeCat}
tab <- as.data.frame(meta$dataDescription$categories)
tab <- arrange(tab, francais)
tab <- select(tab, english, longueur)
tab$longueur <- round(tab$longueur, 2)


tab %>%
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("Categories", "Length (km)"),
    row.names = FALSE,
    caption = "
    Categories of bank segments sensitive to erosion according to their artificiality and their erosion index (EI) considered for the CEA analysis and their total length in $km$ within the bank characterization data of the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence River [@bernier2020; @bernier2021]"
  )
```

<br/>

These four categories were then incorporated into the grid to assess the presence of the various categories of erosion-sensitive banks within the study area. It is important to note that since this valued component has only been identified for the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence, no characterization has been done for the estuary and the Saguenay River. However, a similar characterization was recently published through the Coastal Resilience Project [Projet Résilience côtière](https://ldgizc.uqar.ca/Web/projets/projet-resilience-cotiere) led by Pascal Bernatchez’s team at the Université du Québec à Rimouski.
