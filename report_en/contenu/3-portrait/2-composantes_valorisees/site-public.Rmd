#### Areas of public interest

##### Protected areas

```{r mpa_data, results = 'asis'}
uid <- meta$dataDescription$categories$accronyme %in% 
          c("public_milieu_protege")
meta$dataDescription$categories$source[uid] %>%
sapply(., function(x) stringr::str_split(x, ",")) %>%
unlist() %>%
unique() %>%
sort() %>%
show_source()
```

The protected areas were characterized by integrating three databases. The first database corresponds to the delineation of the different spatial management measures implemented in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park [@apc2021]. This database includes the delineation of regulatory spatial measures (*e.g.* no-shipping zones and slow-down zones) as well as voluntary spatial measures (*e.g.* slow-down zones and avoidance zones). The second database comes from the Government of Canada and delineates environments where management measures are recognized as *other effective conservation measures by area* [EMCEZ; @mpo2021d]. Within our study area, this database shows a single protected area [upstream of the Saguenay River](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/oecm-amcepz/refuges/saguenay-eng.html) that limits fishing activities to protect beluga habitat and to avoid resuspension of contaminated sediments.


Finally, data from the Quebec register of protected areas (Registre des aires protégées au Québec) [@melcc2021] were used to complete the work. This register provides a compilation of protected areas in Quebec -- identified according to the definitions of the Natural Heritage Conservation Act (NHCA; RLRQ, chapter C-61.01) or the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) -- and territories of conservation importance -- identified by the Ministère de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques (MELCC) or an authority of the Quebec government. We removed from this database wildlife habitats, habitats of threatened or vulnerable plant species, and land reserves for protected area purposes because these categories covered the entire study area or because they were covered by other valued components.

##### Heritage sites

```{r patrimoniaux_data, results = 'asis'}
uid <- meta$dataDescription$categories$accronyme %in% 
          c("public_sites_patrimoniaux")
meta$dataDescription$categories$source[uid] %>%
sapply(., function(x) stringr::str_split(x, ",")) %>%
unlist() %>%
unique() %>%
sort() %>%
show_source()
```

<br/>

The characterization of public heritage sites comes from the integration of two databases from the Ministère de la Culture et des Communications. The first database presents data on heritage sites classified by the Minister and which are part of the heritage protected under the Cultural Heritage Act [R.S.Q., c. 21; @mcc2021]. The second database corresponds to heritage sites cited by municipalities and Indigenous communities [@mcc2021b]; these sites are also part of the heritage protected under the Cultural Heritage Act.
