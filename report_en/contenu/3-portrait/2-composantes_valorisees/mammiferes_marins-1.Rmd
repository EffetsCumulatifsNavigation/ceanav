The characterization of marine mammal distribution in the study area was taken from the second edition of a guidebook published for mariners who frequent the Northwest Atlantic [@wwfromm2021]. The purpose of this guide is to inform mariners on the problem of collisions between vessels and whales, how to minimize such incidents, the various species of whales and leatherback turtles in the area and where they might be present, and on areas where heightened vigilance is required. This guide provides distribution maps for nine species of marine mammals that frequent the Northwest Atlantic [@wwfromm2021; @wwfromm2021b]. These species were selected because of their conservation status and their known risk of collision with vessels.

Distribution maps were assessed by integrating 14 separate datasets from scientific and opportunistic sightings (Table \@ref(tab:datamm); @wwfromm2021c). Sighting data covering the period 2010-2015 and geographic boundaries of $40^o$ to $55^o$ N and -72$^o$ to -48$^o$ W were selected to create the maps shared in the guide. The study area was divided into a regular 0.05$^o$ x 0.05$^o$ grid. For each species, the number of sightings recorded in 14 available databases was assessed for each cell of the study grid. A Gaussian smoothing -- *i.e.* an interpolation method based on a normal distribution -- of 0.2$^o$ was then applied to the grid. The values obtained in each cell were normalized by the total number of sightings for a species; the value in a cell therefore represents the proportion of the total number of sightings per species within the study area. Lastly, a log transformation was then applied to minimize the effect of extreme values on the resulting maps.

Caveats accompany these maps and are reported *verbatim* in this report:

> - Sighting effort was not quantified and varies considerably in time and space. The data represent the relative occurrence of reported sightings rather than the actual density or abundance of the species.

> - The quality of some of the sighting data is unknown. Sightings are reported from individuals with varying degrees of expertise in identifying marine mammals.

Of the nine species for which mappings are available, five frequent the St. Lawrence Estuary and the Saguenay River: the St. Lawrence beluga whale (*Delphinapterus leucas*), the minke whale (*Balaenoptera acutorostrata*), the humpback whale (*Megaptera novaeangliae*), the blue whale (*Balaenoptera musculus*), and the fin whale (*Balaenoptera physalus*; Table \@ref(tab:mmSp)). For our study, we resampled the distribution maps produced [@wwfromm2021b] to integrate them into our 1 $km^2$ study grid using the average value of the guide grid cells that intersect each cell in our grid. The values were then normalized between 0 and 1 by dividing each value by the maximum value observed within the grid for each species. The resulting values can be interpreted as the relative density of marine mammal sightings, with values of 0 representing a low relative density 
and a value of 1 a high relative density.

To complete this characterization of marine mammals, we used data from the Marine Mammal Observation Network [MMON; @romm2021] available on the St. Lawrence Global Observatory website ([https://ogsl.ca/bio/?lg=en](https://ogsl.ca/bio/?lg=en)). This database is made up of marine mammal sightings recorded by member observers who have been trained by MMON; the sightings are reported by the public and systematically collected by the MMON team, which then validates these sightings. More information about the program is available on a [dedicated page](https://ogsl.ca/en/biodiversity-marine-mammals-data-information/) on the SLGO website.

This database contains nearly 50,000 marine mammal sightings of 21 different species between 1996 and 2021 [@romm2021]. Of these, we selected data for the period from 2000 to 2021 for species not described in the guide that had more than 50 unique sightings. We applied the same methodology described for the guide to characterize the distribution of four additional species frequenting the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers: harbour porpoise	(*Phocoena phocoena*), harbour seal	(*Phoca vitulina*), harp seal	(*Phoca groenlandica*) and grey seal	(*Halichoerus grypus*; Table \@ref(tab:mmSp)).

It is important to note that the resulting distribution maps for these species are not informed by a process and amount of data similar to what was used to create the marine industry guide [@wwfromm2021]. As with the maps created from Guide data, the resulting values can be interpreted as the relative density of marine mammal sightings, with values of 0 representing a low relative density and a value of 1 a high relative density. An additional caveat must also accompany these data:

> - A lack of data in a sector must not be interpreted as an absence of marine mammals. There are currently no data available on marine mammal traffic for some sectors and some periods of the year.
