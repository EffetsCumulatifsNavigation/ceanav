Accidental spills were characterized using a marine spill incident inventory from the Canadian Coast Guard [@gcc2020]. This inventory provides the location of accidental marine spills for the period `r meta$dataDescription$temporal$start` to `r meta$dataDescription$temporal$end`. A total of `r meta$dataDescription$observations$total` accidental spills were identified for the study area.

Each spill is characterized according to its content and grouped into three distinct groups: hydrocarbons (*e.g.* gasoline, diesel, propane), other (*e.g.* ballast water, wastewater, organic matter) and spills the content of which is unknown (Table \@ref(tab:deversementGen)). The spills are also categorized by the volume in litres of contaminant spilled (Table \@ref(tab:deversementlvl)).

Since accidental spills have an effect that goes beyond the immediate location of the incidents due to the diffusion of the spill in the environment, the first step in characterizing the intensity of spills was to establish a potential zone of influence for each incident. We chose a passive diffusive model to establish the zone of influence and relative intensity of accidental spills in the study area [see @halpern2008a].

The diffusion model establishes the zone of influence of the spills by creating concentric rings with a radius of 10 $m$ centred on the incident site. An initial value equal to the category of the reported incident volume is assigned to the centre ring and represents the relative intensity of the incident on the environment. For example, an initial value of 2 was assigned to a spill of 0 to 100 litres (Table \@ref(tab:deversementlvl)). As a precautionary measure, an initial value of 2 was also assigned to `r meta$dataDescription$classes$number[length(meta$dataDescription$classes$number)]` incidents the volume of which was unknown. A value is then successively assigned to the adjacent rings according to a decay function of 2\% of the value of the previous ring, until a minimum threshold of 0.05\% of the global maximum -- 3 in our case -- is reached. This approach assumes a linear decrease in the influence of the incidents on the environment up to a maximum radius of influence of about 3 $km$ depending on the severity of the spill.

The intensity and spatial distribution of accidental spills in the study area was evaluated by distributing the relative intensity values modelled by the diffusive model within the 1 $km^2$ study grid. For each concentric ring modelled, we multiplied the intensity value within each $j$ of the study grid by the proportion of the ring area that intersects a $j$ cell:

$$I_{d√©versement,j} = \sum_{k=1}^{n_j} I_{tot, k} * \frac{A_{j,k}}{A_{tot,k}}$$

where $j$ is a study grid cell, $k$ is a modelled concentric ring, $I_{tot}$ is the predicted relative intensity within the $k$ ring, $A$ is the area of the $k$ concentric ring that intersects a $j$ cell, and $A_{tot}$ is the total area of the $k$ concentric ring. Since the intensity values correspond to volume categories rather than a continuous quantity, the results of this diffusive model are relative and unitless.
