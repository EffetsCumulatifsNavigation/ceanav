Anchorage sites were characterized through the integration of two databases from the Canadian Coast Guard [@gcc2022] and the Canadian Hydrographic Service [@shc2020]. The Canadian Coast Guard database provides the location of commercial anchorage sites from the mooring data sheets between Les Escoumins and Montreal [@gcc2022]. Since this database does not cover the entire study area, we completed the characterization of anchorage sites using the Canadian Hydrographic Service database; this database provides the location of moorings and mooring areas in Canadian navigable waters [@shc2020]. We selected the moorings and mooring areas east of Les Escoumins in order to complete the profile of the study area. It is important to mention that the resulting data layer considers only commercial navigation and that anchorage sites for recreational boating are not represented. 

A total of `r meta$dataDescription$observations$total` sites were identified in the study area. To characterize the intensity of this environmental stressor, a 2 $km$ buffer zone was drawn around each anchoring site. The number of anchorage sites intersecting each study grid cell was then assessed to obtain an assessment of the number of sites ($n$) per $km^2$ with the potential to affect a cell ($n$ sites * $km^{-2}$). This characterization allows us to obtain an assessment of the environmental risk associated with anchorage sites in each study grid cell by assuming that risks are higher when multiple anchorage sites are located close to each other. It is important to note that we are not characterizing the intensity of use of these sites by vessels here, but rather the presence of anchorage sites. Anchorage site use could be characterized in an updated version of this stressor; however, this work could not be completed as part of this report.
