  #   1. Modify volume in classes from 1 to 5
  #       1 = 0 litre
  #       2 = 0 - 100 litres
  #       3 = 100 - 1000 litres
  #       4 = 1000 - 7000 litres
  #       5 = 100000 - 1000000 litres
  #   2. 5km buffer around spills (totally arbitrary, no scientific basis, just for viz)
  #   3. Intersect with grid
  #   4. Sum of intersects in each grid cell
